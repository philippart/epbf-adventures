The majority of these vulnerabilities is related to issues in the eBPF verifier, JIT compiler, loader or bpf helper functions allowing out-of-bound memory access.

## ðŸ”¥ CVE-2020-8835: Improper eBPF Program Verification

Reference: [zerodayinitiative](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2020/4/8/cve-2020-8835-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation-via-improper-ebpf-program-verification)

This vulnerability exploits a bug in the eBPF verifier (the program that validates eBPF programs when they are loaded) to perform a local privilege escalation.
In the Linux kernel 5.5.0 and newer, the bpf verifier (kernel/bpf/verifier.c) did not properly restrict the register bounds for 32-bit operations, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory


## ðŸ”¥ CVE-2021-3490: Improper eBPF Program Verification

Reference: [chompie1337](https://github.com/chompie1337/Linux_LPE_eBPF_CVE-2021-3490/tree/main/include)

The eBPF ALU32 bounds tracking for bitwise ops (AND, OR and XOR) in the Linux kernel did not properly update 32-bit bounds, which could be turned into out of bounds reads and writes in the Linux kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution.

This is very similar to the above.
