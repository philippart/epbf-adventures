# eBPF Adventures

This project has 3 goals:
1. Learning the basics of Extended Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPF)
2. Experimenting with a few applications (networking and observability) 
3. Understanding known vulnerabilities

## ✅ Introduction to eBPF

For an introduction to eBPF and a selection of sites and blog posts, please refer to [introduction](docs/introduction.md).

## ✅ Sample programs and tooling

A short survey and testing of the available developer toolchains can be found in [toolchain](docs/toolchain.md).

Sample programs can be found under the `src` directory.

## ✅ eBPF vulnerability survey

A summary of eBPF vulnerabilities: [vulnerabilities](docs/vulnerabilities.md).

## ✅ eBPF for good and for bad

A summary of eBPF used for good and for bad: [security](docs/security.md).
