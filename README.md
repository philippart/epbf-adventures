# eBPF Adventures

This project has 3 goals:
1. Learning the basics of Extended Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPF)
2. Experimenting with a few applications (networking and observability) 
3. Understanding known vulnerabilities

## Introduction to eBPF

For an introduction to eBPF and a selection of sites and blog posts, please refer to [introduction.md](docs/introduction.md).

## Sample programs and tooling

A short survey and testing of the available developer toolchains can be found in [toolchain.md](docs/toolchain.md).

Sample programs can be found under the `src` directory.

## eBPF vulnerability survey

A summary of eBPF used for bad (vulnerabilities and malware): [vulnerabilities](docs/vulnerabilities.md).

## eBPF security monitoring

A summary of eBPF used for good to detect security breaches: [security](docs/security.md).
